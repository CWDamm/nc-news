# README

## Description
This portfolio project was created as part of a Digital Skills Bootcamp in Software Engineering provided by [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/)

As part of the back-end phase of the bootcamp, I built an API using news article data provided by Northcoders. For more details of this initial project, see https://github.com/CWDamm/be-nc-news

For the front end phase, I developed this single page app using React and Vue, making requests to the existing API endpoints. A version hosted with Netlify is available at https://nc-news-cwdamm.netlify.app/

The home page provides a list of all articles showing the headline, images, number of votes and number of comments. Articles can be sorted by a range of parameters and there are separate pages for different topics. 

Users are able to log-in using the username provided on the log-in page, or as any of the users shown on https://be-nc-news-cwdamm.onrender.com/api/users

Each article also has it's own page, where you can up or down-vote the article, and if logged in, make a comment.
